      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <hr />
      <div class="info">
        <div class="text-pretty">
          <p>
            Ningguang is a tall woman with fair skin, red eyes and an overall
            elegant appearance. She has long straight hair, where half of it is
            tied up into a wide bun resembling a bow, and the rest falls into
            two divided parts. Her hair is white, reaches her knees and fades
            into an ashy color. Her bun is accessorized with a black hairpin,
            and she wears a red tassel decoration atop her head which lays
            between her eyes.
            <br /><br />
            Ningguang wears a white, high-necked sleeveless qipao dress with
            side slits that reach up to the thigh. The side slit in her dress
            reveal black shorts with diamond cut patterns. Her Geo Vision is
            placed on her left midriff. Her gloves are decorated with copper
            patterns and claw attachments on the thumb, ring, and pinky fingers
            that act as fingernail guards. Ningguang also carries a smoking pipe
            with her.
            <br /><br />
            Her outfit, Gold Leaf and Pearly Jade, is described to have
            intricate embroidery which is the hallmark of this graceful dress.

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <hr />
      <div class="info">
        <p>
          Ningguang is a professional businesswoman, having accumulated her
          wealth through hard work and perseverance. As the Tianquan, she is
          known for being highly meticulous in her work and holds a large amount
          of influence within Liyue.
          <br /><br />
          She is a calculating and ruthless businesswoman guided by the sole aim
          of making Mora, which stems from her impoverished background.
          She makes use of a large intelligence network and "pawns" to gain the
          information she needs, and will only make use of people whose
          weaknesses she knows. As a result, she is disliked by those with
          significant influence, but nonetheless, many accept it as she adds to
          the overall prosperity of both the Qixing and Liyue Harbor itself.
          <br /><br />
          Despite her cold, business-driven exterior, she has Liyue's best
          interests at heart. Under her decree in response to a case of water
          contamination, those who intentionally endanger public health and
          safety should be "shown no mercy whatsoever." When Osial was
          reawakened and threatened Liyue Harbor, she put her conflict with the
          adepti aside and ultimately sacrificed the Jade Chamber, her life's
          work, to seal it away. She is also particularly fond of children, both
          because they give her vital intelligence and because she enjoys seeing
          them smile.
