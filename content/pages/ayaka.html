          <strong>
            Kamisato Ayaka <em>(Japanese: 神かみ里さと綾あや華か)</em> is a
            playable Cryo character in Genshin Impact. She is the oldest
            daughter of the Kamisato Clan and sister of Kamisato Ayato. Being
            beautiful, elegant, and graceful, the common folk have nothing to
            bad-mouth Ayaka about. Because of her social status as the eldest
            daughter of the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission and as the
            Shirasagi Himegimi, Ayaka is seen as a model of perfection.

            Ayaka is a young woman of slightly below average height. She keeps
            her long, pale white-blue hair tied in a high ponytail by a black
            armored headdress accented with gold. Her hair is styled in a hime
            cut, with evenly chopped locks framing her face tied off with white
            accessories bordered with gold, fastened with bright pink cords tied
            in cloverleaf knots. Her light blue-gray eyes are accompanied by
            thick lashes and a mole underneath her left eye.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her outfit, Flawless Radiance, is described as a kimono that
            displays the nobility and resilience of the Shirasagi Himegimi. It
            consists of a royal blue pleated knee-length skirt embroidered with
            an assortment of patterns, bearing gold accents and small white
            flower print, and black geta sandals with ankle-length white socks
            decorated by pink cloverleaf knots at the back. She has a black
            breastplate with a golden Kamisato Clan emblem in the center and
            matching armor platings on the sides of her skirt. Underneath her
            breastplate is a loose elbow-length shirt with gradients of blue to
            white. Her cuffs and collar on her top are navy with a variety of
            gold stripes. She wears black sleeves underneath the loose shirt,
            sling over her middle fingers, and covering both of her thumbs. On
            top of her black sleeves are white armored platings lined by gold
            metal, tied together by red knots. At the back of her outfit is a
            large royal blue bow, tied together by her Vision and another bright
            pink cloverleaf knot. The lower half of the ribbons darken in color
            with gold markings seemingly native to her homeland. As an
            accessory, she carries around a gold-navy fan that matches her
            skirt.

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <hr />
      <div class="info">
        <p>
          Ayaka is a kind-hearted girl with a pleasant temperament who treats
          others with politeness and courtesy. She holds the people of Inazuma
          dear to her heart and often goes out of her way to personally assist
          in all kinds of matters; being a member of the Yashiro Commission, she
          feels that she must meet the people's needs. She is a perfectionist
          with an earnest personality. Her dedication often moves people, and
          those close to her gave her the honorary title of Shirasagi Himegimi
          (Japanese: 白しら鷺さぎの 姫ひめ君ぎみ Shirasagi no Himegimi, "White
          Heron Princess"). People in the neighborhood always talk about her
          with sincere admiration.
          <br /><br />

          Thanks to the influence of Ayaka's excellent upbringing, her heart is
          as pure as crystallized ice. Just like the splendid colors reflected
          as the ice crystals spin in the winter air, such is Ayaka's spirit.
          While the people of Inazuma love her, it is also well known that she
          has very few friends due to her upbringing — Thoma is her only known
          friend until she met the Traveler. She is also busy to the point that
          she doesn't have much free time, to begin with, so she has trouble
          mingling with others. When not burdened with her duties, she shows a
          tender, cute side to her.
          <br /><br />

          But if you want to capture a heart hanging high in the sky, you must
          have the ability to climb up the clouds. In other words, Ayaka is
          eager to associate with people capable of achieving great feats — in
          her eyes, friendships are dictated by fate, the same way she was
          destined to wield her frost-covered sword.
