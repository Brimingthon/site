                Zhongli <em>(Chinese: 钟离 Zhōnglí)</em> is a playable Geo character
                in Genshin Impact. He is a consultant of the Wangsheng Funeral
                Parlor. He is later revealed to be the current vessel of the Geo
                Archon, Morax, who has decided to experience the world from the
                perspective of a mortal.</strong

            <p>
                Zhongli currently appears as a tall man with fair skin and a stern
                expression. His eyes are bright and sharp, amber in color with
                glowing yellow pupils set in the shape of diamonds. He wears red
                eyeliner on the lower lids of his eyes. When using Geo, his eyes
                become luminescent. His dark brown hair is styled in a windswept
                fashion with a longer fringe that hangs from the right side of his
                face. It fades to amber brown at the tips and is pulled back in a
                long ponytail that falls beyond his waist. When he is using his Geo
                abilities, his amber highlights glow. This appearance is also used
                in The Statues of The Seven's depiction of Rex Lapis around Liyue.
            </p>
            <p>
                His attire is elegant and form-fitting, consisting of a beige dress
                shirt, a brown and amber waistcoat, slim black trousers, black dress
                boots, and black gloves with twin silver archer rings on the thumbs.
                His neckpiece is a white tie pinned at the throat by an amber
                gemstone. His left ear is adorned with a jeweled tassel earring.
                Over everything, he wears a long dark brown tailcoat with dragon
                scale patterns, gold and silver accents, golden tassels, and Rex
                Lapis' diamond symbol on the back. Zhongli's clothes are decorated
                with diamond symbols found on his sleeves, belt, trousers, waistcoat
                buttons, and tailcoat buttons. Similarly to Venti, because he was an
                Archon with an innate Gnosis, the "Vision" embedded on his chain at
                the small of his back is nothing more than a fake.

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr />
    <div class="info">
        <p>
            Zhongli is a calm, reserved, and polite man, who holds an air of
            nostalgia. He knows much about Liyue's history and culture in part due
            to his time as the Geo Archon; like Venti, he has many experiences and
            memories, as he was a god well before The Seven even existed and one
            of the oldest still living in Teyvat. He holds philosophical ideas
            towards money and has great respect for Liyue's traditions, including
            those that have been forgotten or warped over time. Zhongli tends to
            be humble, being worried he comes off as a "bourgeois parasite."
            <br><br>

            Zhongli tends to forget about Mora in transactions, agreeing to spend
            large sums of it without having any Mora on hand and even taking
            "discounts" as granted despite being an obvious scam. He often ends up
            relying on his acquaintances for financial support, such as the
            Wangsheng Funeral Parlor or Childe. Although he works for Hu Tao, he
            does not like her childish behavior.
            <br><br>

            It is later revealed that Zhongli's "carelessness" stems from being
            the creator of Mora. With the Gnosis allowing him to create limitless
            Mora, he never had to worry about running low on his personal
            finances. Unfortunately, when he chose to live among mortals, he
            lacked the foresight to find an alternative for them to continue
            minting Mora in his absence, along with creating a retirement fund for
            himself. As a result, he shamelessly spends the Mora of others.
